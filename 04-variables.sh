## Variable is a name which is associated to a set of data.
## Advantage: Change of data in one place will replicate in all the places where that variable is used.

## Declare a variable

a=20 # Number
b=xyz # characters
c=r200 # string
d=20.90 # float

# observations
# unlike other scripting languages shell does not have data types by default.
# Every thing is a string

## Access variables

##DATE=$(date)
##echo welcome Good morning today date is $DATE

##echo welcome Good morning today date is $(date)


##read -p 'Enter your name : ' name
##echo $name


##echo "the first argument is : $2"
##echo "the first argument is : $1"
#echo "the first argument is : $#"
#echo "the first argument is : $*"
#echo "the first argument is : $$"
#echo "the first argument is : $@"
#echo "the first argument is : $?"
##echo "the first argument is : $!"
